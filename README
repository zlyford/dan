Rapid prototype of audio matching software for the semester project. 

Usage, from the assignment specification: 

    ./dan -f <pathname> -f <pathname>

where <pathname> is a Linux path name that ends in ".wav" for
a file that already exists on the CCIS shared file system and
is in WAVE format with CD-quality parameters (AudioFormat 1,
stereo, 16 bits per sample, 44.1 kHz sampling rate).

The "dan" file should be executable from the command line without any kind of
compiling needed. If the two given files match, it will return:

    MATCH <file1> <file2>

where the files are the short file names given in the command. If the files do
not match, it will return:

    NO MATCH

if an invalid command is given, it will return 

    ERROR: incorrect command line

If a specified file is in an incorrect format, it will return:

    ERROR: <file> is not a supported format
    
If a file could not be opened for reasons including the file not existing:
    
    ERROR: <file> could not be opened
    
The program only uses libraries that are included on the CCIS Linux machines
and does not use any third party external libraries.
