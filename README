Rapid prototype of audio matching software for the semester project. 

Usage, valid commands from the assignment specification: 

    ./dan -f <pathname> -f <pathname>
    ./dan -d <pathname> -d <pathname>
    ./dan -f <pathname> -d <pathname>
    ./dan -d <pathname> -f <pathname>

Where <pathname> following -f is either:
1) A Linux path name that ends in ".wav" for a file that
already exists on the CCIS shared file system and is in
WAVE format with CD-quality parameters (AudioFormat 1,
stereo, 16 bits per sample, 44.1 kHz sampling rate)
2) A Linux path name that ends in ".mp3" for a file that
already exists on the CCIS shared file system and is in
the MPEG-1 Audio Layer III format

And where <pathname> following -d is a Linux path name
that designates a directory that exists on the CCIS
shared file system and contains files that adhere to the
requirements of a file following a -f option

The "dan" file should be executable from the command line without any kind of
compiling needed. If the two given files match, it will return:

    MATCH <file1> <file2>

where the files are the short file names given in the command. If a directory
is specified, a match statement will be returned for each match recognized
by the program.

if an invalid command is given, it will return 

    ERROR: incorrect command line

If a specified file is in an incorrect format, it will return:

    ERROR: unsupported format

If a file could not be opened for reasons including the file not existing:

    ERROR: could not open file

If a directory could not be opened or does not exist, it will return:

    ERROR: invalid directory

The program only uses libraries that are included on the CCIS Linux machines
and does not use any third party external libraries.
