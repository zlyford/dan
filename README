Prototype of audio matching software for the semester project.

Usage, valid commands from the assignment specification: 

    ./dan -f <pathname> -f <pathname>
    ./dan -d <pathname> -d <pathname>
    ./dan -f <pathname> -d <pathname>
    ./dan -d <pathname> -f <pathname>

Where <pathname> following -f is either:
1) A Linux path name that ends in ".wav" for a file that
already exists on the CCIS shared file system and is in
WAVE format with CD-quality parameters (AudioFormat 1,
stereo, 16 bits per sample, 44.1 kHz sampling rate)
2) A Linux path name that ends in ".mp3" for a file that
already exists on the CCIS shared file system and is in
the MPEG-1 Audio Layer III format

And where <pathname> following -d is a Linux path name
that designates a directory that exists on the CCIS
shared file system and contains files that adhere to the
requirements of a file following a -f option

The "dan" file should be executable from the command line without any kind of
compiling needed. If the two given files contain a match, it will return:

    MATCH <file1> <file2> <offset1> <offset2>

where the files are the short file names given in the command. If a directory
is specified, a match statement will be returned for each match recognized
by the program. The two file names are followed by the offset in seconds
of the beginning of the match in the first file and then the offset in
seconds of the beginning of the match in the second file respectively.

if an invalid command is given, it will return 

    ERROR: incorrect command line

If a specified file is in an incorrect format, it will return:

    ERROR: unsupported format

If a file could not be opened for reasons including the file not existing:

    ERROR: could not open file

If a directory could not be opened or does not exist, it will return:

    ERROR: invalid directory

The program only uses libraries that are included on the CCIS Linux machines
and does not use any third party external libraries.
